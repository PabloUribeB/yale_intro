# Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub
This repository was created for a training session with incoming Yale predocs about version control using GitHub. Most of the material is taken from the [World Bank DIME Analytics](https://github.com/dime-wb-trainings/lyrics-msfr24) Git training. 

## About the training
This training is intended for beginners who want to learn about best practices for contributing to a project using GitHub. It is especially helpful for someone who is joining a team that is already using Git/GitHub, or that is about to start, and has a team member that is experienced with GitHub workflows. This training will not teach you how to create a repository, how to set up work flows and best practices for a team using Git/GitHub, or how to solve conflicts in a repository. However, you will be able to figure out most of them yourself after this training, if you are willing to use Google a little bit.
