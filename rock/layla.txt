What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been runnin' and hidin' much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

[Chorus]
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Verse 2]
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
It turned my whole world upside down

[Chorus]
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

So make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain
